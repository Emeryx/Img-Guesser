A 2-8 player fullstack web game where participants need to guess the right animal is displayed on an image from a predefined large database from 4 different options.

Game hosts have the ability to choose the number of rounds (3-12) and the time per round in seconds (15-75)

Players can join by typing their desired display name and room code

The participant with the highest score wins

Players have random icons also relating to animals.

The game has a few phases that are displayed to the players:
Lobby, Round, Round End and Game End

Players have a "ready" state. The game progresses only when everyone hit the "ready" button whether in the lobby or in the round end phase.


The project uses Vite, React, MUI's Joy UI for the front end, And uses NestJS, MongoDB, Express and Socket.IO for the back end
